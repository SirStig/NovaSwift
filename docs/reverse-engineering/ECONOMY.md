# The trade economy — commodity pricing, junk, and disasters

This doc does **not** re-derive the `spöb` flag-word layout (services bits,
the six commodity-price nibbles, tech level, `DefenseDude`/`DefCount`, etc.)
— that's already decoded field-by-field in `docs/SHIP_SYSTEM.md` and
`Sources/NovaSwiftKit/NovaEconomy.swift`. This doc is about the **behavior**
those fields drive: what actually sets a price, what changes it over time,
and what the two ancillary trade resources (`jünk`, `öops`) do.

## 0. Relevant game constants (Part I, lines 37–68)

| Constant | Value |
|---|---|
| Max Cargo Types | 256 |
| Max Junk Types | 128 |
| Max Disasters | 256 |

The six standard commodities (food/industrial/medical/luxury/metal/equipment)
occupy cargo-type slots 0–5 of the 256; `jünk` types are a separate pool of up
to 128, addressed by their own resource IDs, not by cargo-type index. (Mission
cargo, per `novaswift-ai-system`/`novaswift-missions-story` notes elsewhere, uses
IDs ≥ 6 in the same 256-slot cargo-type space as the standard six — `jünk`
appears to be a parallel resource family rather than sharing that index space;
the Bible never states the two are unified, and nothing cross-references a
`jünk`'s "cargo type" with the 0–255 numbering used for the `öops.Commodity`
field. See open question in §4.)

## 1. Base commodity pricing model

The Bible documents pricing for the six standard commodities through **two
separate mechanisms** that must be combined:

1. **Per-stellar price *tier*** — the `spöb` `flags` word (lines 2791–2814)
   ORs in one of four states per commodity: "won't trade" (0x0), Low, Medium,
   or High. This is per-stellar, per-commodity, and static for that stellar
   (it's a flag baked into the `spöb` resource, not something that drifts
   tick-to-tick). Already decoded as `SpobRes.priceLevel(_:)` in
   `Sources/NovaSwiftKit/NovaEconomy.swift:127-130`.
2. **The actual credit values behind Low/Medium/High** — Appendix III,
   "Patching STR# Resources" (lines 3580–3609), lists a chart of `STR `
   resource ID ranges a plugin can override without touching the built-in
   `STR#` resource. It includes:

   > `Base prices of commodities` — replacement `STR ` ID range **9300-9305**
   > `Commodity abbreviations for status display` — **9400-9405**

   Six IDs, one per standard commodity (food, industrial, medical, luxury,
   metal, equipment, in that order — matching `STR# 4000`'s commodity-name
   ordering used elsewhere in the data). **This means the numeric base
   prices are themselves scenario data** (patchable per-plugin via `STR ` 9300-9305), not a hardcoded
   engine constant. The Bible doesn't spell out the exact arithmetic that
   turns one "base price" string into three Low/Medium/High numbers (no
   formula like "Low = base × 0.8" is stated anywhere in the document), but
   the existence of exactly one base-price string per commodity — not three —
   implies Medium is that base value and Low/High are computed offsets from
   it, most likely a fixed or per-commodity delta baked into the engine
   itself (see the discrepancy noted in §5: the current Swift table's
   Low/High deltas are *not* a single constant percentage across all six
   goods, e.g. food is ±20%, medical is ±11%, so whatever the true rule is,
   it isn't "one universal percent" — it's either per-commodity-tuned data or
   an engine formula the Bible doesn't expose).

3. **Tech level does *not* gate commodity trading.** `spöb.TechLevel` and
   `SpecialTech` (lines 2825–2836) only govern which *outfits* and *ships*
   (by their own `TechLevel` field) are offered — the commodity-exchange
   fields are entirely separate flag bits with no tech dependency. A tech-1
   backwater and a tech-8 capital can both trade "High" food if their flag
   bits say so.
4. **Government affiliation does not modify commodity price either.**
   `spöb.Govt`/`MinStatus` (lines 2839–2854) gate *landing clearance*
   (whether you're allowed to dock at all, based on your legal standing with
   that government), not the price you pay once you're there. No field
   anywhere in the `spöb` resource applies a government-specific markup or
   discount to commodities.
5. **No day-to-day price drift for standard commodities beyond `öops`.**
   Outside of an active `öops` disaster (§4), nothing in the `spöb` resource
   varies a commodity's price over time — the Low/Medium/High tier is a
   static property of the stellar for the life of the game (or plugin). Any
   "market feels alive" fluctuation in real Nova comes entirely from the
   `öops` system layered on top, not from an independent supply/demand
   simulation.

**Tribute** (`spöb.Tribute`, line 2817) is a related but distinct economic
field — the per-day (or lump, if unspecified) credit payout to the player
once a stellar is dominated, defaulting to `1000 × TechLevel` credits/day if
set to -1 or 0. It has nothing to do with commodity trading, but is the other
place the Bible attaches a credit formula to a stellar.

## 2. Buy/sell spread

**The Bible does not document a buy/sell spread for standard commodities.**
No field in `spöb`, and no prose anywhere in the document, describes a
different price for selling a commodity than for buying it — the
Low/Medium/High price *is* "the price," full stop, for both directions. (Junk
is even more explicit about this — see §3, `jünk.BasePrice` is singular, not
a buy/sell pair.) Nova's commodity exchange models a single spot price per
good per stellar, not a bid/ask spread; profit comes entirely from buying Low
at one stellar and selling High (or during a favorable `öops`) at another,
not from a built-in transaction cost.

## 3. Junk cargo (`jünk` resource, lines 1163–1207)

Junk resources describe "specialized commodities that can be bought and sold
at a few locations" — a parallel, much narrower trade-goods system layered on
top of the six standard commodities:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `SoldAt1-8` | Up to 8 stellar-object IDs where this junk type is available to buy. 0/-1 = unused slot. |
| `BoughtAt1-8` | Up to 8 stellar-object IDs where this junk type can be sold. 0/-1 = unused slot. |
| `BasePrice` | "The average price of the commodity (works much like the base prices for 'regular' commodities)" — a single average price, not a Low/Medium/High per-stellar tier. |
| `Flags` | `0x0001` Tribbles — multiplies in the cargo bay over time. `0x0002` Perishable — decays away in the cargo bay over time. |
| `ScanMask` | Illegal-cargo bitmask, ANDed against a ship's government's `ScanMask` (same mechanism as `oütf.ScanMask`) — if any bits match, that government considers this junk type contraband. |
| `LCName` / `Abbrev` | Player-info-dialog name / status-bar abbreviation. |
| `BuyOn` / `SellOn` | Control-bit test expressions gating availability to buy/sell — independent boolean gates, not percent chances. |

Key differences from the six standard commodities:

- **Location-gated, not tier-gated.** Standard commodities trade at *any*
  stellar with a commodity exchange, at a price set by that stellar's
  Low/Med/High flag. Junk trades **only** at the specific stellar IDs listed
  in `SoldAt1-8`/`BoughtAt1-8` — a junk type might be sellable at exactly one
  station in the galaxy and buyable nowhere (pure salvage/mission-flavor
  loot), or vice versa.
- **Single average price, no per-stellar tier.** `BasePrice` is one number
  per junk type; there's no Low/Medium/High mechanism for junk the way there
  is for standard goods.
- **No `BuyRandom`-style daily availability roll documented for junk.**
  Unlike `oütf.BuyRandom`/`shïp.BuyRandom` (§5), the `jünk` resource has no
  percent-chance field at all — its only gates are the boolean `BuyOn`/`SellOn`
  control-bit expressions and the fixed `SoldAt`/`BoughtAt` stellar lists.
- **Two unique cargo-bay side effects not shared with standard goods**:
  Tribbles (self-multiplying) and Perishable (self-decaying) — both purely
  junk-flag behaviors; no standard commodity has an analogous flag.
- **Can be illegal cargo** via `ScanMask`, exactly like outfits — standard
  commodities have no `ScanMask` field and are never contraband.

## 4. The `öops` "disaster" system (lines 1792–1819)

The Bible is explicit that the name is a misnomer: "Oops resources contain
info on planetary disasters. Actually, the term 'disasters' is a misnomer, as
these occurrences simply affect the price of a single commodity at a planet
or station, for good or bad." It's a scripted, timed price-modifier event,
not a catastrophe with any other gameplay effect. "Nova uses the name of the
resource in the commodity exchange dialog box to indicate that a disaster is
currently going on at a planet" — i.e. the resource's own name string doubles
as the in-UI label shown to the player while it's active.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Stellar` | Scope of the disaster. `128-1628`: a specific stellar object ID. `-1`: "Any planet or station (use sparingly)" — a galaxy-wide roll, presumably applied independently per qualifying stellar or globally per the Bible's own caution against overuse. `-2`: "Nothing (used for mission-related news)" — a no-op disaster that exists purely to drive news/flavor text, with no price effect at all. |
| `Commodity` | Which of the six standard commodities to affect: 0 = food, 1 = industrial, etc. (the Bible's own example enumerates only the standard six; empirically, every real `öops` record in the base game stays within 0–5 — see resolved question below). |
| `PriceDelta` | The amount to raise or lower the affected commodity's price. Negative = price drop. Additive to the stellar's existing Low/Med/High price, not a replacement or a percentage. |
| `Duration` | How many days the disaster lasts before its price effect reverts. |
| `Freq` | **Percent chance per day that the disaster will occur.** This is a per-day Bernoulli roll, not a scheduled/deterministic trigger — every eligible day, there's an independent `Freq`% chance the disaster fires (and, presumably, is excluded from re-rolling while already active for its `Duration`, though the Bible doesn't state re-entrancy rules explicitly). |
| `ActivateOn` | Control-bit test expression. "Leave blank if unused." An additional gate on top of the `Freq` roll — the disaster can only trigger on days where this expression evaluates true (e.g. gating a disaster to only be eligible after a certain mission/story flag is set). Blank = no gate, `Freq` alone governs eligibility. |

Putting the fields together, the trigger semantics are: on each game day, if
`ActivateOn` is unset or evaluates true, roll a `Freq`-percent chance; on a
hit, apply `PriceDelta` to `Commodity`'s price at `Stellar` for `Duration`
days, and surface the `öops` resource's own name in the commodity-exchange
dialog as the "what's happening here" label for the duration.

**Resolved (as far as this method can tell):** whether `Commodity` can
reference a `jünk` type (via some ID offset above 5) or is strictly limited
to the six standard indices 0–5. Two independent pieces of evidence now
point the same way:

1. **The TMPL itself is typed.** `öops`'s `Commodity` field (TMPL #512,
   `third_party/ResForge/Plugins/Sources/NovaTools/Templates.rsrc`) is a
   `CASR` enum listing exactly six named cases, `Food=0` through
   `Equipment=5` — no "or a jünk ID" case, no open-ended integer hint. The
   editor's own authoring UI presents this as a closed six-way choice, not a
   free-form resource-id picker (contrast with `Stellar`@0, which *is* typed
   as a raw `RSID`/free integer).
2. **Every real `öops` record in the base game stays in range.** All 19
   `öops` resources that ship with EV Nova (`Nova Data 2.rez`, ids 128–146 —
   the only `.rez` file that has any; see `swift run novaswift-extract list
   "data/EV Nova/Nova Files/Nova Data 2.rez" öops`) were dumped with
   `swift run novaswift-extract raw "data/EV Nova" öops <id>` for id in
   128...146. `Commodity`@2 is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 in every single one —
   never higher. Several are semantically self-confirming, which is stronger
   than a bare range check: #143 "The discovery of a new ore deposit" has
   `Commodity`=4 (metal) with `PriceDelta`=-110; #144 "The discovery of a new
   drug" has `Commodity`=2 (medical) with `PriceDelta`=-150; #134 "A spate of
   break-downs" has `Commodity`=5 (equipment) with `PriceDelta`=+115; #128
   "An enormous food surplus" has `Commodity`=0 (food) with `PriceDelta`=-15.
   The disaster's own name and its `Commodity` index line up correctly every
   time, which only makes sense if `Commodity` really is indexing the six
   named goods, not some other resource family.

Absence of evidence isn't proof — there is no `jünk`-referencing counter-example anywhere
to point to, and the sample is limited to the 19 stock `öops` records (a
third-party plugin could still choose to abuse the field with an
out-of-range value the engine happens to tolerate). But between the TMPL's
closed six-case enum and 19/19 real records staying in range with several
showing exact name↔commodity semantic matches, this is as close to a
confirmed "no" as the reverse-engineering method can produce without engine
source. Treat `öops` as standard-commodity-only.

## 5. What's implemented vs. what's missing

> **Design note (updated):** the two resources below (`jünk`, `öops`) that used
> to be "implemented but not wired" now are wired — see
> [JUNK_OOPS_DESIGN.md](JUNK_OOPS_DESIGN.md) for the design doc that guided the

| Bible spec | Swift status | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| `spöb` flag word → per-stellar Low/Med/High/not-traded tier per commodity | ✅ Implemented | `SpobRes.priceLevel(_:)`, `Sources/NovaSwiftKit/NovaEconomy.swift:127-130` |
| Numeric credit values for Low/Medium/High | ✅ **Implemented and wired.** `NovaGame.commodityBasePrice(_:)` now reads the `STR ` 9300-9305 override (one Pascal-string resource per commodity, `overrideString(_:)`), and `NovaGame.commodityPrices(_:)` re-anchors this build's existing per-commodity Low/High offsets around that value, falling back to the untouched hardcoded `Commodity.prices` table when no override exists. `commodityMarket(at:)` — already consumed by `TradeCenterView` in `app/NovaSwift/Spaceport/SpaceportScreens.swift:47` — now calls `commodityPrices(_:)` instead of the raw table, so this is live in the trade UI, not just decoded. **Empirically verified against the real base-game data**: none of the 22 base resource files (`Nova.rez`, `Nova Files/*.rez`) contain any `STR ` (single-string) resources at all — only `STR#` (indexed list) resources exist (`swift run novaswift-extract types <file>` on each of the 22 files). So `commodityBasePrice` returns `nil` for every commodity in the stock game and the fallback table is what's actually live today; the override path is real, tested-by-inspection code that a plugin's own `STR ` 9300-9305 resources would activate, matching the Bible's Appendix III description of that range as a *plugin* override mechanism, not something the base game itself populates. | `NovaGame.commodityBasePrice(_:)`/`commodityPrices(_:)`/`overrideString(_:)`, `Sources/NovaSwiftKit/NovaEconomy.swift:165-205`; consumed at `Sources/NovaSwiftKit/NovaEconomy.swift:230` (`commodityMarket`) → `app/NovaSwift/Spaceport/SpaceportScreens.swift:47` |
| Tech level does not gate commodity trading | ✅ Correctly not implemented as a gate (no code applies `techLevel` to `commodityMarket`) | `Sources/NovaSwiftKit/NovaEconomy.swift:171-178` |
| Buy/sell spread | N/A per Bible (none specified) | Matches: `TradeCenterView.buy()`/`sell()` and `PilotStore.buyCommodity`/`sellCommodity` both transact at the single `c.price` — `app/NovaSwift/Spaceport/SpaceportScreens.swift:107,120`, `app/NovaSwift/Game/PilotStore.swift:182-203` |
| `jünk` resource (salvage/specialty cargo) | ✅ **Implemented and wired.** `JunkRes` (byte layout, TMPL #509, `Templates.rsrc`, 676 bytes, no KEYB/union ambiguity) is a real decoder — `NovaGame.junk(_:)`/`junks()`. It is now consumed outside `NovaSwiftKit` too: `TradeCenterView.market` (`app/NovaSwift/Spaceport/SpaceportScreens.swift:29-101`) builds junk buy/sell rows straight from `game.junks()`, gated by the `BuyOn`/`SellOn` NCB tests and the `SoldAt`/`BoughtAt` stellar lists (`TradeRow.Origin.junk`). Junk cargo shares the pilot's standard-commodity cargo dictionary, including the Tribbles (multiply)/Perishable (decay) side effects (`tickJunkCargo`, `app/NovaSwift/Game/PilotStore.swift:210-262`). `ScanMask` contraband is wired too: `Sources/NovaSwiftKit/Contraband.swift:55-57` (`isCargoContraband`) is consumed by `Sources/NovaSwiftStory/ContrabandScan.swift:49`. Confirmed layout (`swift run novaswift-extract tmpl ".../Templates.rsrc" 509`, cross-checked against all 23 real records in `Nova Data 1.rez`, ids 128-150, via `swift run novaswift-extract raw "data/EV Nova" jünk <id>`): `SoldAt1-8`@0 (8× `RSID`, 16B) `BoughtAt1-8`@16 (8× `RSID`, 16B) `BasePrice`@32 (`WORD`, 2B) `Flags`@34 (`WORV`, 2B) `ScanMask`@36 (`WB16`, 2B) `LCName`@38 (`C040`, 64B) `Abbrev`@102 (`C040`, 64B) `BuyOn`@166 (`n0FF`/NCB Test, 255B) `SellOn`@421 (`n0FF`/NCB Test, 255B) — **total 676 bytes**, matching the real record size exactly. Verified against #128 "Vrenna Ice Lizard Pelts": `SoldAt`={219, 449, -1×6}, `BoughtAt`={164, 175, 207, 242, 267, 345, -1, -1} (all real spöb ids), `BasePrice`=750 (sane credit value), `Flags`=0, `ScanMask`=2048 (0x0800); the ASCII view shows `"ice-lizard pelts"` and `"Pelts"` landing exactly at the computed `LCName`/`Abbrev` byte offsets. `BasePrice` sampled across all 23 real ids ranges 50-3000 credits (always plausible); `Flags` was 0 (no Tribbles/Perishable bit) in every one of the 23 base-game records sampled — no counter-example of those two flags actually in use was found in the stock data. | `Sources/NovaSwiftKit/JunkModels.swift` (`JunkRes`, `NovaGame.junk(_:)`/`junks()`); `Sources/NovaSwiftKit/FourCharCode.swift:67` (`.junk = "jünk"`); `app/NovaSwift/Spaceport/SpaceportScreens.swift:29-101`; `app/NovaSwift/Game/PilotStore.swift:210-262`; `Sources/NovaSwiftKit/Contraband.swift:55-57`; `Sources/NovaSwiftStory/ContrabandScan.swift:49` |
| `öops` "disaster" price-event system | ✅ **Implemented and wired.** `OopsRes` (byte layout, TMPL #512, `Templates.rsrc`, 282 bytes, no KEYB/union ambiguity) is a real decoder — `NovaGame.oops(_:)`/`oopses()`, with `commodityEnum`/`appliesToAnyStellar`/`isNewsOnly` convenience accessors. The per-day `Freq` roll and expiry now run in `Sources/NovaSwiftStory/StoryEngine.swift:658-676` (`evaluateDisasters`, called every day from `advanceDays`), tracking active disasters in `player.activeDisasters` (stellar/commodity/expiry, keyed by öops id). `NovaEconomy`'s `disasterPriceDelta(spobID:commodity:activeOops:)` (`Sources/NovaSwiftKit/OopsModels.swift:112-118`) sums the additive `PriceDelta` for every active disaster matching a stellar/commodity, and is consumed at `app/NovaSwift/Spaceport/SpaceportScreens.swift:78-83` (`TradeCenterView.market`) on top of the Low/Med/High price. One divergence from the original design plan ([JUNK_OOPS_DESIGN.md](JUNK_OOPS_DESIGN.md) §B.3) worth noting: the daily roll uses the shared, stateful `StoryRNG` (`rng.chance(percent:)`) rather than a pure deterministic hash of `(day, oopsID)`, so it is not guaranteed to reproduce identically across relaunches the way the `BuyRandom` stocking hash does — see that doc's implementation-status note. A second gap: no UI yet shows the active disaster's name as a banner in the trade dialog (`OopsModels.swift`'s `activeDisasterNames` has no callers) — only the price effect is applied, per JUNK_OOPS_DESIGN.md §B.5. Confirmed layout (`swift run novaswift-extract tmpl ".../Templates.rsrc" 512`, cross-checked against all 19 real records in `Nova Data 2.rez`, ids 128-146, via `swift run novaswift-extract raw "data/EV Nova" öops <id>`): `Stellar`@0 (`RSID`, 2B) `Commodity`@2 (`CASR` 6-case enum, 2B) `PriceDelta`@4 (2B) `Duration`@6 (2B) `Freq`@8 (2B) `ActivateOn`@10 (`n100`/NCB Test, 256B) `[unused]`@266 (`F010`, 16B) — **total 282 bytes**, matching the real record size exactly. Verified against #128 "An enormous food surplus": `Stellar`=137 (real spöb id), `Commodity`=0 (food — matches the disaster's own name), `PriceDelta`=-15 (a *surplus* correctly drops the price), `Duration`=30 days, `Freq`=35% (sane 0-100 range), `ActivateOn`=blank. All 19 real records show sane `Freq` (25-75%) and `Duration` (15-100 days) values; several show the `Commodity` index semantically matching the disaster's own name (#143 "discovery of a new ore deposit" → `Commodity`=4/metal; #144 "discovery of a new drug" → `Commodity`=2/medical; #134 "spate of break-downs" → `Commodity`=5/equipment). See §4 below for the resolved `Commodity`-range question. | `Sources/NovaSwiftKit/OopsModels.swift` (`OopsRes`, `NovaGame.oops(_:)`/`oopses()`, `disasterPriceDelta`); `Sources/NovaSwiftKit/FourCharCode.swift:68` (`.oops = "öops"`); `Sources/NovaSwiftStory/StoryEngine.swift:658-676`; `app/NovaSwift/Spaceport/SpaceportScreens.swift:78-83` |
| Tribute payout when dominated | ❌ Not implemented — `spöb.Tribute` and the domination flag (`spöb` Flags2 `0x0020` "always dominated") aren't wired to any credits-per-day mechanic in `PilotStore` or `World`. | — |
| `oütf.BuyRandom` / `shïp.BuyRandom` (per-day stock availability) | ✅ Implemented (most recent commit `ff8fc20`, "Enhance item availability mechanics with BuyRandom feature") — a deterministic FNV-1a hash of `(day, spobID, itemID)` compared against the percent chance, so stock is stable within a day and re-rolls only when the day advances. Correctly encodes the Bible's per-type zero-behavior asymmetry (outfits: `BuyRandom <= 0` → always available; ships: `BuyRandom == 0` → never available). | `Sources/NovaSwiftKit/NovaEconomy.swift:185-232`; fields decoded at `Sources/NovaSwiftKit/NovaModels.swift:240,280` (`ShipRes.buyRandom` @904) and `Sources/NovaSwiftKit/NovaAIModels.swift:157,181` (`OutfRes.buyRandom` @1008) |
| `jünk`/`öops` equivalent of a "daily availability roll" | N/A — the Bible documents no `BuyRandom`-style field for junk; junk availability is purely the fixed `SoldAt`/`BoughtAt` stellar lists plus the boolean `BuyOn`/`SellOn` gates, confirmed absent from the byte layout above (no percent-chance field anywhere between `ScanMask`@36 and the two NCB test strings). | — |
| Cargo-hold interaction (capacity, load/unload) | ✅ Implemented, standard commodities only — `ShipLoadout.cargoCapacity`, `PilotStore.cargoFree/cargoUsed/held/buyCommodity/sellCommodity`. Not yet extended to a junk inventory — `JunkRes` now exists as a decoder (see the `jünk` row above) but nothing attaches it to the pilot's cargo dictionary, so this is a wiring gap, not a missing-model gap anymore. Doesn't model Tribbles self-multiplication or Perishable decay (`jünk.Flags` 0x0001/0x0002) since no junk cargo exists in the pilot's cargo dictionary at all yet. | `Sources/NovaSwiftEngine/ShipLoadout.swift:62,105,135,175`; `app/NovaSwift/Game/PilotStore.swift:151-203` |

### Third-party reference check

`third_party/NovaJS` (partial TypeScript reimplementation) has no commodity/
trade/economy logic — its "commodity"/"price"/"trade" hits are all in the
*outfitter* parser/UI (`OutfitParse.ts`, `outfitter.ts`, `OutiftData.ts`),
which is about outfit items, not the six standard trade goods or `jünk`/
`öops`. It offered nothing usable for this doc beyond confirming the
outfitter item-grid metrics already cited in `docs/SHIP_SYSTEM.md`'s sibling
UI work (`SpaceportScreens.swift:18-25`).
